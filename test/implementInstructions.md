Lodash
In this project, you will be implementing some of the most exciting functionality from the widely-popular lodash.js library which provides many methods that add new functionality for numbers, strings, objects, and arrays.

If you wanted to use this library in your own projects right now, you could load it, using a Content Delivery Network (CDN) link, in the <head> of your projectâ€™s index.html file , like so:

<head>
  <script src='https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/lodash@4.17.20/lodash.min.js'></script>
  <!-- Make sure that you load lodash before the file that uses it. -->
  <script src='file-that-uses-lodash.js'></script>
</head>
